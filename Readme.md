## Etsy Search Page

Re-Create An Etsy Page - https://www.etsy.com/search?q=whiskey

> Specifically you need to focus on the sidebar and the main content of items. While I would love to see the header/footer coded out, please do that last and I will not require it to be done.

1. Utilize the data for whatever search term you use - [DATA HERE](https://api.etsy.com/v2/listings/active?api_key=h9oq2yf3twf4ziejn10b717i&keywords=whiskey&includes=Images,Shop)
2. Use Bourbon / Neat to help you out (optional, but suggested)
3. You are free to change the search term to whatever you'd like.
4. We haven't covered how to fetch data using JavaScript, so just copy the data and store it in a variable.
5. Everything should be styled as closely as possible.
6. You should implement hover events and link the items to their proper Etsy product pages
7. Unless you do the bonus question #2, you can just put random links in your sidebar.


## Deliverables

1. Push to Github and comment with a link to your repo
2. Push to Github Pages and comment with a link to that
3. Close the Issue


## Go Further

1. Create your own API token by signing up as an [Etsy developer](https://www.etsy.com/developers/)
2. Pull the categories from the data to create the sidebar, with links that filter the listings.
3. Implement the sorting dropdown.
