"policy_additional": "Additional Terms of Agreement: \r\n\r\nBy using nickpc, you are agreeing to the terms of service below without exception. If you have any questions, please contact me before making your payment. \r\n\r\n{ Refund Policy }\r\n\r\nBecause of the digital nature of nickpc products, full payment or in some cases a 50% payment is due up front for all custom design work. nickpc does not issue refunds unless notified within 24 hours of purchase or before work has begun (whichever comes first). Please be sure that you are ready to begin working by having your content ready before making a purchase. \r\n\r\n{ Communication }\r\n\r\nOnce I begin working on your project, your participation is frequently needed. You are responsible for checking your email and providing feedback on my design(s) in a timely manner.  It is important that I keep open projects progressing at a reasonable speed to meet deadlines and attend to clients who are waiting to receive my services. Failure to communicate in a timely manner will result in one of the following depending on your payment plan.\r\n\r\n- Full Payment Sent: Your project will be placed on a waiting list until I am contacted by you. Once I am contacted again, you will be given a time frame of when I can begin working on the project. If I do not hear from you within six months: your project is considered abandoned and will be cancelled without any additional notification from myself. \r\n\r\n- 50% Payment Plan: You will be invoiced for the full payment amount and will be placed on a waiting list. Payment is due immediately. You may contact me when you are ready to begin working on the project again. Once I am contacted, I will give you a time frame of when I can begin working on the project. If I do not receive the 2nd payment within one month of sending you the final invoice than your project is considered abandoned and will be cancelled. You will not receive a refund for the work that has been completed (your first payment) and I will not pick up work where I left off. \r\n\r\n{ Cross-Browser Compatibility }\r\n\r\nAll of my designs meet the strict W3C standards of modern browsers including Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Apple Safari.  I am not responsible for differences that may appear when older browser versions or third party plugins not certified by myself that are used. If you&#39;re still using IE6 or IE7 I can also recommend the name of a good doctor.\r\n\r\n{ Management of Content }\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise discussed and included in your quote, you are responsible for creating and sending me your own content. This includes all of the text, media, and links that you would like included on your website. Pictures should be sent to me in the quality and size that you want them on your website. Photo editing is provided at an additional cost if needed. I will require all of the content once the coding process begins. \r\n\r\n{ Design Credit }\r\n\r\nMy design credit will be placed on the footer of your website. You may not remove or alter the design credit. Your design is a reflection of my design style.  If your website has been altered to the point where it no longer reflects my work, I may ask that you remove the credit at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n{ Site Maintenance }\r\n\r\nEach custom website design that nickpc creates includes FREE complimentary support for seven days. This is to allow for small changes in the coding of your website. After seven days have passed I am happy to make changes to your website at my hourly rate. \r\n\r\n{ Copyright and Liability }\r\n\r\nIt is your responsibility to obtain the proper permission for any provided graphics. nickpc is not liable for any provided graphics. Please do not provide graphics to nickpc to use if you do not have the proper permissions. The copyrights of your design are retained by nickpc. Designs are not to be altered or resold to anyone.",

"policy_additional": "Additional Terms of Agreement: \r\n\r\nBy using nickpc, you are agreeing to the terms of service below without exception. If you have any questions, please contact me before making your payment. \r\n\r\n{ Refund Policy }\r\n\r\nBecause of the digital nature of nickpc products, full payment or in some cases a 50% payment is due up front for all custom design work. nickpc does not issue refunds unless notified within 24 hours of purchase or before work has begun (whichever comes first). Please be sure that you are ready to begin working by having your content ready before making a purchase. \r\n\r\n{ Communication }\r\n\r\nOnce I begin working on your project, your participation is frequently needed. You are responsible for checking your email and providing feedback on my design(s) in a timely manner.  It is important that I keep open projects progressing at a reasonable speed to meet deadlines and attend to clients who are waiting to receive my services. Failure to communicate in a timely manner will result in one of the following depending on your payment plan.\r\n\r\n- Full Payment Sent: Your project will be placed on a waiting list until I am contacted by you. Once I am contacted again, you will be given a time frame of when I can begin working on the project. If I do not hear from you within six months: your project is considered abandoned and will be cancelled without any additional notification from myself. \r\n\r\n- 50% Payment Plan: You will be invoiced for the full payment amount and will be placed on a waiting list. Payment is due immediately. You may contact me when you are ready to begin working on the project again. Once I am contacted, I will give you a time frame of when I can begin working on the project. If I do not receive the 2nd payment within one month of sending you the final invoice than your project is considered abandoned and will be cancelled. You will not receive a refund for the work that has been completed (your first payment) and I will not pick up work where I left off. \r\n\r\n{ Cross-Browser Compatibility }\r\n\r\nAll of my designs meet the strict W3C standards of modern browsers including Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Apple Safari.  I am not responsible for differences that may appear when older browser versions or third party plugins not certified by myself that are used. If you&#39;re still using IE6 or IE7 I can also recommend the name of a good doctor.\r\n\r\n{ Management of Content }\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise discussed and included in your quote, you are responsible for creating and sending me your own content. This includes all of the text, media, and links that you would like included on your website. Pictures should be sent to me in the quality and size that you want them on your website. Photo editing is provided at an additional cost if needed. I will require all of the content once the coding process begins. \r\n\r\n{ Design Credit }\r\n\r\nMy design credit will be placed on the footer of your website. You may not remove or alter the design credit. Your design is a reflection of my design style.  If your website has been altered to the point where it no longer reflects my work, I may ask that you remove the credit at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n{ Site Maintenance }\r\n\r\nEach custom website design that nickpc creates includes FREE complimentary support for seven days. This is to allow for small changes in the coding of your website. After seven days have passed I am happy to make changes to your website at my hourly rate. \r\n\r\n{ Copyright and Liability }\r\n\r\nIt is your responsibility to obtain the proper permission for any provided graphics. nickpc is not liable for any provided graphics. Please do not provide graphics to nickpc to use if you do not have the proper permissions. The copyrights of your design are retained by nickpc. Designs are not to be altered or resold to anyone.",
